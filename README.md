# Bag of Visual Words

The code installs OpenCV, mounts Google Drive, imports required libraries, defines functions to extract features from images and cluster the descriptors, and construct histograms of visual words using the Bag of Words representation.

The `get_files` function reads images from the specified directory, converts them to grayscale, and returns them as a dictionary of image categories with a list of corresponding images.

The extract_features function extracts SIFT features from each image in the dataset and stores them in a dictionary with their corresponding image categories.

The `cluster_descriptors` function uses KMeans clustering to cluster the SIFT features and returns the visual vocabulary, which is a list of cluster centers.

The `distance_to_centers` function calculates the Euclidean distance between each feature and the closest cluster center and returns a dictionary of features assigned to each cluster.

The `construct_histogram` function constructs a histogram of visual words for each image by counting the number of features assigned to each cluster center and normalizing the histogram by its L1 norm.

Overall, the code demonstrates a pipeline for extracting features from images, clustering them, and constructing histograms of visual words using the Bag of Words representation. This pipeline is commonly used in computer vision applications such as image classification and object recognition.
